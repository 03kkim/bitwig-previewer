# bitwig-previewer

## Usage
This script offers a simple but powerful paradigm for keeping bounces/exports *within* their respective project folders, but easily previewable in the Finder.

To use:
1. Set your projects directory and preview (output) directory
2. Prefix any audio files that you want in your previews with "pv-" (e.g. "pv-my project.mp3")
3. Run the script using `bash bwprev`
